### What is need of the time complexity?

We deal with hugh amount of data, so we need to understand when to use certain data structure in order to get desired space or time efficiency.

### What is time complexity?

- It is the measure of how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size grows...
- We do asymptotic analysis to measure it.
- It is expressed using Big O notation

### What is Asymptotic Analysis?

- We are interested in the properties of the properties of the function $f(n)$ as $n$ becomes very large.
- The function $f(n) = n^2 + 3n$, then $n$ becomes very large, the term 3n becomes insignificant compared to $n^2$. The function $f(n)$ is said to be 'asymptotically equivalent to $n^2$, as $n$ tends to  $\infin^\infin$. This is often written symbolically as $f(n) \sim n^2$ which is read as '$f(n)$ is asymptotic to $n^2$.
- In short it means, what the function becomes when $n$ tends to $\infin$ or $n$ becomes very large.  
 
### What is Big O notation?
Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

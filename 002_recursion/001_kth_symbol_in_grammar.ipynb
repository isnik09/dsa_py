    "### Question \n",
    "We build a table of n rows (1-indexed). We start by writing 0 in 1st row. Now in every subsequent row, we look at the previous row and replace each occurrence of 0 with 01, and each occurrence of 1 with 10. For example, for $n = 3$ the 1st row is 0, the 2nd row is 01, and the third row is 0110. Given two integer n and k, return the kth (1-indexed) symbol in the nth row of a table of n rows. "

## What is recursion? 
Function calling itself until base condition / terminating condition is validated is recursion. 

## When to use recursion? 
If we can solve the problem with dividing it into subproblem them we can solve it using recursion. 

## Recursive Leap of faith
- 1. Understand the problem
- 2. Identify subproblem 
- 3. Trust/Faith...?
  - You have to trust that this recursive call will correctly solve a smaller version of your problem. 
  - You don't try to mentally simulate or "unroll" the recursion; 
  - instead, you assume that if your function works for simpler case it will work more for more complex ones. 
- 4. Link 1. and 2. 
- 5. Base Condition

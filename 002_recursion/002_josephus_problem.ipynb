    "There are n friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered form 1 to n in clockwise order. More formally, moving clockwise from the ith friend brings you to the (i+1)th friend for $1 < = i < n$, and moving clockwise from the nth friend brings you to the 1st friend. \n",
    "The rules of the game are as follows : \n",
    "- 1. Start at the 1st friend \n",
    "- 2. Count next k friends in the clockwise direction including the friend you start at. The counting wraps around the circle and may count some friends more than once. \n",
    "- 3. The last friend you counted leaves the circle and loses the game. \n",
    "- 4. If there is still more than one friend in the circle, go back to step 2 starting from the friend immediately clockwise of the friend who just lost and repeat. \n",
    "- 5. Else, the last friend in the circle wins the game. \n",
